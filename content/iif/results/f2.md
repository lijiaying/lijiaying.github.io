# IIF experiment results:

This is the result of our implementation of the paper [An Invariant Inference Framework by
Active Learning and SVMs](./IIF.pdf) by Li Jiaying.

For you to run the experiments on your own machine, please follow the steps below to set up your experiment environment.

## Setup:

Dependencies:

* [libsvm](https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/) remember to put {libsvm}/bin folder into $PATH
* [klee](https://klee.github.io/)

Optional dependencies:

* [libdwarf](http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/repo/pkgs/libdwarf/) for C programs

**NOTE**: If you have difficulty in installing libdwarf, the following page may help you.
