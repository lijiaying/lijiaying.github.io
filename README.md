[Curriculum Vitae](http://lijiaying.github.io/cv/cv_en_2023_11.pdf)

Currently, I am working for Saas team under Bing Platform in Microsoft, China.   
Before that, I was a research scientist in SCIS, SMU (Singapore Management University), Singapore,   
a research fellow in ISTD, SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design).  
I got my PhD degree from SUTD, and my Bachelor degree from Nankai University, China.  


During my early academic exploration years, I had great honors to be supervised by Prof. [Sun Jun](http://sunjun.site/) (SUTD, Singapore, currently at SMU, Singapore).  
I also had a wonderful experience when visiting Prof. [Su Zhendong](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/) (UC Davis, US, currently at ETH Zurich, Switzerland)



## Education Background
* Ph.D. in [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), [Singapore University of Technology and Design](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/), Singapore
* Visiting Scholar in Department of Computer Science, [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), California, USA
* M.Sc. (dropped) in [Institute of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/), Beijing, China
* B.E. in College of Software, [Nankai University](http://www.nankai.edu.cn), Tianjin, China



## Research Interests
**Software Verification, Programming Languages, Artifitial Intelligence**

My primary research focuses on the correctness of software systems, including but not limited to  
classic computer programs, smart contracts and artificial intelligence systems. I also have a broad  
interest in both the theoretic and practical aspects of software analysis, testing and verification.    
My vision is to develop new theories and pratices to help practitioners build trustworthy and high-  
quality software systems.

I welcome all the collabration from academia and industrials. Send me an email if you are interested.
