[Curriculum Vitae](http://lijiaying.github.io/cv/cv.pdf)

I will join Microsoft, China, soon. Currently I am a research scientist in SCIS, SMU. Before that, I was a research fellow in ISTD, SUTD after I got my PhD
degree there. I got my bachelor degree from Nankai University, China.


## Education Background
* B.E. in College of Software, [Nankai University](http://www.nankai.edu.cn), Tianjin, China
* M.Sc. (dropped) in [Institute of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/), Beijing, China
* Ph.D. in [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), [Singapore University of Technology and Design](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/), Singapore
* Visiting Scholar in Department of Computer Science, [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), California, USA


## Research Interest
Software testing, verification, or other security-related, learning-related topics

#### Current Interested Topics:
+ Neural network related:
	- Why do adversarial examples show the transferability between different models?
	- Does local robustness a good measurement for neural network security? If not, how can we define a better one?
	- What's the upper bound of global robustness for a given dataset? How can we approach, or even arrive at it?
	- How to generate hard-to-detect adversarial examples?

+ Constraint solving related:
	- Is there any efficient way to prove a constraint is unsat?
	- Whether a constraint is sat or unsat is deterministic problem, if the space is finite. In other words, it is
		discrete. Can we make it continuous, or even differentiable?
	- For infinite search space, how to estimate the gap between sat and unsat? [open question]
	- Build a lattice-based solvers, compositional. [great engineering effort is required.]

+ Program analysis related:
	- Test constraint solvers
	- Test numerial domains
	- Differential interpretation. 
	- Simplify existing program analysis techniques. 

Drop me an email if you are intested in any topic and self-motivated.
