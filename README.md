[Curriculum Vitae](http://lijiaying.github.io/cv/cv_en.pdf)(might be outdated.)

Currently, I am working for Saas team under Bing Platform in Microsoft, China. 
Before that, I was a research scientist in SCIS, SMU (Singapore Management University), Singapore, 
a research fellow in ISTD, SUTD (Singapore University of Technology and Design). 
I got my PhD degree from SUTD, and my Bachelor degree from Nankai University, China.


During my early academic exploration years, I had great honors to be supervised by Prof. [Sun Jun](http://sunjun.site/) (SUTD, Singapore, currently at SMU, Singapore). 
I also had a wonderful experience when visiting Prof. [Su Zhendong](https://people.inf.ethz.ch/suz/) (UC Davis, US, currently at ETH Zurich, Switzerland)



## Education Background
* B.E. in College of Software, [Nankai University](http://www.nankai.edu.cn), Tianjin, China
* M.Sc. (dropped) in [Institute of Computing Technology](http://english.ict.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/), Beijing, China
* Ph.D. in [Information Systems Technology and Design](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/), [Singapore University of Technology and Design](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/), Singapore
* Visiting Scholar in Department of Computer Science, [University of California, Davis](https://www.ucdavis.edu/), California, USA



## Research Interests
**Formal Verification, Programming Languages, Software Engineering, Artifitial Intelligence**

My primary research focuses on the correctness of software systems, including but not limited to classic computer 
programs, smart contracts and artificial intelligence systems. I also have a broad interest in both the theoretic 
and practical aspects of software analysis, testing and verification. My vision is to develop new theories and 
pratices to help practitioners build trustworthy and high-quality software systems.

I welcome all the collabration from academia and industrials. Send me an email if you are interested.
