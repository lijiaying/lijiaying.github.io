### Research Interests
In general, my research interest is PROGRAM ANALYSIS and SOFTWARE ENGINEERING. 
Currently I work on the topic to find loop invariant for a given program with loops in it, 
which stays at the heart of program verification and also the hardest part in this area.

I am also interested in machine learning and operating system topics.
